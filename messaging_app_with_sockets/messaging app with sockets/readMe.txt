This is the messaging application we created as a project. The programming language used is java. 

The following features can be accesed while using the application:
-chatting with other users
-you can see the users that are connected
-subscribe to topics
-the list of users subscribed to the topic 

First, you need to open and run Server->Main.java, then open the Client->Main.java. If you want to test multiple times, run Client->Main.java multiple times.
Also,if you want to run the project, you have to import from Maven the Gson. You can do that by checking FILE->Project Structure -> Libraries ->click on "+" and add com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6

Now everything should run properly.
In order to send a message to a user, in the terminal you will be asked for a name, and then you can start chatting. 


We hope you will enjoy using it!
Stay connected! ðŸ™‚
